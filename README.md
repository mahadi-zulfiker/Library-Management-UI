# Minimal Library Management System - Frontend

This is the frontend client for a minimal library management system, built with React, Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query), TypeScript, and styled with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI. It provides a clean and functional interface for managing books and tracking borrowing activities.

This project is part of a full-stack application. The backend API source can be found [here](https://github.com/mahadi-zulfiker/Library-Management-API). The live backend API is deployed at [https://library-management-drab-xi.vercel.app/](https://library-management-drab-xi.vercel.app/).

## ‚ú® Features

* **Public Access:** All pages are accessible without authentication.
* **Book Management (CRUD):**
    * **Book List Table:** View all books with details (Title, Author, Genre, ISBN, Copies, Availability).
    * **Edit Book:** Update existing book information with instant UI reflection. If copies are set to 0, the book is marked as unavailable.
    * **Delete Book:** Remove books with a confirmation dialog.
    * **Add New Book:** Form to create new book entries.
* **Borrow Book:**
    * Simple form to borrow books, specifying quantity and due date.
    * Business logic prevents borrowing more than available copies.
    * If copies reach 0 after borrowing, the book is marked unavailable.
* **Borrow Summary:** Displays an aggregated list of borrowed books by title and total quantity.
* **Responsive UI:** Fully responsive layout adapting to mobile, tablet, and desktop devices using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI.
* **Optimistic UI Updates:** Provides a smooth user experience by instantly updating the UI for delete and update operations before the server response.
* **Toast Notifications:** Informative messages for user actions (success, error).
* **Type-Safe Forms:** Enhanced form validation and type safety using React Hook Form and TypeScript.
